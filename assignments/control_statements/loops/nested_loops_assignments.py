# Find all prime numbers between 2 and n
"""
The standard definition of prime numbers applies only to
positive integers greater than 1. A prime number is defined
as a number that has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.
For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. are prime numbers
because they can only be divided evenly by 1 and themselves
without leaving a remainder.
